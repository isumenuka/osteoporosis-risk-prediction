# Osteoporosis Risk Prediction Model (DSGP Group 40)

This repository contains a clean, step-by-step implementation of the **Osteoporosis Risk Prediction Model** using Google Colab notebooks only. The structure is designed so that anyone can follow the pipeline easily without worrying about local Python setup.

> Note: Most files under `data/`, `models/`, `figures/`, and `outputs/` are **generated inside Colab** when you run the notebooks.

## 🚀 How to Use (Google Colab Only)

1. **Open the repository in GitHub**  
   https://github.com/isumenuka/osteoporosis-risk-prediction

2. **Open each notebook in Google Colab**
   - Click on a notebook (e.g., `01_Environment_Setup.ipynb`)
   - Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (or copy the GitHub URL into Colab > File > Open Notebook > GitHub)

3. **Run notebooks in order**

   1. `01_Environment_Setup.ipynb`  
      Installs all required libraries (`xgboost`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `shap`, `joblib`) and creates folders.

   2. `02_Data_Preparation.ipynb`  
      - Load `osteoporosis_cleaned_reorganized.csv` from Google Drive or local upload
      - Perform basic EDA, demographic analysis, and save `data/dataset_loaded.csv`

   3. `03_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`  
      - Handle missing values
      - Encode binary and multi-category features
      - Scale **Age** using `StandardScaler`
      - Create interaction features (e.g., `Age_x_Hormonal`)
      - Save `data/preprocessed_data.csv` and `models/age_scaler.pkl`

   4. `04_Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb`  
      - Split data into male and female cohorts
      - Train two XGBoost models (Male/Female)
      - Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC
      - Generate confusion matrices and ROC curves
      - Save models and performance plots

   5. `05_SHAP_Explainability.ipynb`  
      - Run SHAP summary plots, bar plots, and force plots
      - Save explainers to `models/shap_explainers.pkl`

## ✅ Design Goals

- **Google Colab–First**: No local Python or virtualenv setup is required.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each notebook handles one clear stage: setup → EDA → preprocessing → training → evaluation → explainability.
- **Reproducible Pipeline**: All intermediate artefacts are saved (`data/`, `models/`, `outputs/`, `figures/`).
- **Explainable ML**: SHAP analysis integrated as a first-class step for clinical transparency.

## 📦 Dataset

- File: `osteoporosis_cleaned_reorganized.csv`
- Location: Keep it in your **Google Drive** or upload directly inside Colab.
- Characteristics: 1,958 records, 15 clinically meaningful risk indicators, perfectly balanced classes (0/1).

## 🔗 Useful References

The logic of these notebooks follows your detailed documentation:
- *Osteoporosis_Component_Documentation.docx*
- *Osteoporosis_Model_Complete_Guide.pdf*

If you update your methodology there, we can easily sync the notebooks.

If you want, I can later add:
- A separate notebook for **inference + simple web form demo**
- A notebook for **GitHub → Colab workflow** (clone repo, run directly from GitHub)
